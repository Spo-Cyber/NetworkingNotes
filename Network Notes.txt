Network Devices👨‍💻
(Chapter 2)

Device - Description - Key Points
Router - Connects networks - A router uses the software-configured network address to make forwarding decisions.

Switch - Connects devices on a twisted-pair network - A switch forwards data to its destination by using the MAC address embedded in each packet. It forwards data only to nodes that need to receive it.

Multilayer Switch - Functions as a awitch or router - Operates on Layers 2 and 3 of the OSI model as a switch and can perform router functionality.

Firewall - Provides controlled data access between networks - Firewalls can be hardware or software based. They are an essential part of a network’s security strategy.

IDS/IPS - Detects and prevents intrusions - Monitors the network and attempts to detect/prevent intrusion attempts.

Load balancer - Distributes network load - Load balancing increases redundancy and performance by distributing the load to multiple servers.

Proxy - Sends resource requests on behalf of network clients - Can add to the security and bandwidth efficiency of the network.

Network Attached Storage (NAS) - Centralized storage device that connects to a network - Provides scalability and flexibility for the large amounts of storage today.

Storage Area Network (SAN) - A high-speed network that connects storage devices to servers - Allows mulitple servers to easily and efficiently access large amounts of storage.

Access Point (AP) - Enables wireless devices to connect to wireless and wired networks - Should provide the latest in security standards to help reduce security breaches.

Controller - Used with branch/remote office deployments for wireless authentication - When an AP boots, it authenticates with a controller before it can start working as an AP.

		#IP (Internet Protocol) Types

Internet Protocol (IP) is a network layer protocol, documented in RFC 791, that offers a connectionless internetwork service.IP provides features for addressing, packet fragmentation and reassembly, type-of-service specification, and security.

- -
Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) , in addition to TCP and UDP , is another transport layer protocol , documented in RFC 792 that reports errors and provides other information relevant to IP packet processing.It is used by utilities such as ping and traceroute.
- -
Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) , is a transport layer 'RELIABLE' protocol.'RELIABLE' means that if a segment is dropped , the sender can detect that drop and retransmit the dropped segment.
- -
User Datagram Protocol (UDP) can be considered an opposite approach to TCP.Unlike TCP,UDP offers unreliable transport.This means that if a segment is dropped, the sender is unaware of the drop, and no retransmission occurs.
- -
Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE).For example, let’s say you have traffic that you want to protect over an IPsec tunnel, but this traffic is multicast traffic. IPsec does not support securing this type of traffic. That is where GRE can come into play. The multicast can be encapsulated inside GRE, and then this GRE traffic can be protected by IPsec.
- -
Internet Protocol Security (IPSec) is a complex suite of protocols that is used to create secured connections between network systems.IPSec features the use of Authentication Header(AH) and Encapsulating Security Payload(ESP).AH handles authentication functions, while ESP takes care of encryption.IPSec also gets help from Internet Key Exchange(IKE) protocol.IKE negotiates cryptographic keys and security parameters to facilitate the secure IPSec data transmissions over the Internet.

		#Traffic Types

Unicast - one-to-one communication.the most network traffic , which travels from a single source device to a single destination device.(IP Range - Class A,B,C)

Broadcast - one-to-all communication.travels from a single source to all destinations on a network(broadcast domain` 255.255.255.255).Another type of broadcast address is a directed broadcast address, which targets all devices in a remote network (for example` 172.168.255.255/16).(IP Range - 255.255.255.255)

Multicast - one-to-many communication.offers an efficient mechanism for a single host to send traffic to multiple specific destinations.The router/switch receives data only once, and sends it to devices which want.The router must support PIM,IGMP for routing to the devices which are interested for getting data.(IP Range - Class D` 224.0.0.0 - 239.0.0.0)

Anycast - one-to-nearest communication (from a sender to the nearest of multiple receivers).Multiple devices share the same anycast IP address, but packets are routed to the nearest(or best) destination based on routing metrics such as shortest path or lowest latency.

Note - IPv6 doesn't support broadcast traffic, besides it uses a special all-nodes IPv6 multicast address.

	#Network Topology, Architecture and Types

IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) - an internationally recognized standards body

- - - - - - - -

LAN (Local Area Network) - interconnects network components within a local area (for example, within a building).

WLAN (Wireless Local Area Network) - LAN made up of wireless network devices.

WAN (Wide Area Network) - interconnects network components that are geographically seperated(for example, corporate headquarters can have multiple WAN connections to remote office sites).

SAN (Storage Area Network) - a network, which is high-speed, highly reliable, for the express purpose of transmitting stored data.

CAN (Campus Area Network) - a network, that connects multiple buildings within a limited geographical area (such as a university, corporate campus, or military base).LAN < CAN < MAN 

MAN (Metropolitan Area Network) - a network, that spans an entire city or large area, connecting multiple LANS and CANs over a larger geographical region.CAN > MAN > WAN

PAN (Personal Area Network) - a network, whose scale is even smaller than LAN(for example, a connection between a PC and a digital camera via a universal serial bus'USB' cable could be considered a PAN.)

Client/Server Model

A central server provides services/data to multiple clients(devices).For Example , Websites, email servers, cloud storage, etc...

Pros:
	Centralized management(easy to control)
	Better security(admin controls access)
	Handles many users efficienlty(scalable)
Cons:
	Needs a powerful server(expensive)
	If the server fails, everything stops

- - -

Peer-to-Peer(P2P) Model

All devices(peers) are equal and share resources directly without a central server.For example(Torrenting, LAN gaming, Bluetooth file sharing).

Pros:
	No central point of failure(more reliable)
	Cheaper(no need for expensive servers)
	Scalable(more peers = more resources)
Cons:
	Harder to secure(no central control)
	Slower for large networks(no dedicated management)

- - -

Cloud Networking

Cloud Networking is the use of cloud-based resources to manage, control, and connect networks instead of using traditional on-premises hardware.(Everything is virtualized)

Pros:
	Scalable(Expand or reduce network size easily)
	Cost-Effective(No need for expensive on-site hardware)
	Accessible Anywhere(Managed remotely via the internet)
Cons:
	Depends on Internet
	Secuity Risks(Data is stored outside your control)
	Latency Issues(Can be slower than local neworking)

Point-to-Point(P2P) Topology

Direct connection between two devices.(For Example, Ethernet cable between two computers)

Pros: Fast & Secure(no interference)
Cons: Not Scalable(only two devices)
- - -
Star Topology

All devices connect to a central switch/hub.(For Example, Home Wi-Fi router with multiple devices)

Pros: Easy to manage & troubleshoot.If one device fail, others work.
Cons: Central hub failure(entire network down)

- - -
Hub-and-Spoke Topology

Like star topology, but used in WANs.(For example, branch offices connected to HQ via VPN)

Pros: Cost-effective(only one central link needed).Easier to manage than full mesh.
Cons: Central hub failure disrupts all-spokes.

- - -
Full-Mesh Topology

Every device is directly connected to every other device in the network.It creates a redundant and highly resilient network.Every node connects to all other nodes.(For Example, a data center with multiple servers interconnected for reliability).
W = N * (N - 1)/2, where W = the number of WAN links and N = the number of sites.

Pros:
	High redundancy(if one link fails, data can take another route)
	No single point of failure(ensures network reliabilty)
	Fast data transfer(direct communication between devices)
Cons:
	High cost(requires more cables and hardware, making it expensive)
	Complex setup(managing connections can be difficult as the network grows)
- - -
Partial-Mesh Topology

Network setup where some devices are directly connected to each other, but not all devices are interconnected.It's a compromise between full-mush and other simpler topologies.

Pros:
	Less expensive than full-mush(Fewer cables and devices required)
	Improved redundancy(Some level of backup connectivity between devices)
	Scalable(Easier to expand than full-mesh)
Cons:
	Some points of failure(Not all devices have backup connections)
	Not as reliable as full-mesh(if a critical goes down, it may disrupt communications)
