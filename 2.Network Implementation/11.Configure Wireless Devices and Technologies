#WLAN Concepts and Components

Enterprise-class WLANs, and even most WLANs in homes, are configured in such a way that a wireless client connects to some sort of wireless base station, such as a wireless access point (AP) or a wireless router. Many companies offer Wi-Fi as a service, and users in range of an AP can use the AP as a hotspot, indicating that Wi-Fi is available through the AP.This communication might be done using a variety of antenna types, frequencies, and communication channels.

Wireless Routers

The cable modem obtains an IP address via DHCP from the Internet service provider (ISP).The wireless router behind the modem also uses DHCP to provide IP addresses to LAN devices attaching to it wirelessly or through a wired connection. The process through which a wireless client (for example, a laptop or a smartphone) attaches with a wireless router (or wireless AP) is called association. All wireless devices associating with a single AP, share a collision domain. Therefore, for scalability and performance reasons, WLANs might include multiple APs. The router then uses port address translation to allow packets to leave the LAN and head to the Internet.

Wireless Access Point

Although a wireless access point (AP) interconnects a wired LAN with a WLAN, it does not interconnect two networks (for example, the service provider‚Äôs network and an internal network).
The AP connects to the wired LAN, and the wireless devices that connect to the wired LAN via the AP are on the same subnet as the AP. Notice that no NAT or PAT is being performed. The access point is acting as a wireless bridge between the wireless clients connected to the AP and the wired devices connected to the switch in the same Layer 2 domain.

Autonomous access points: These APs are self-contained network devices that manage all wireless network functions independently, without the need for a central controller. They are equipped with built-in capabilities to handle tasks such as service set identifier (SSID) broadcasting, client authentication, security enforcement, and traffic routing. Each autonomous access point operates as a standalone unit, making them suitable for smaller networks or environments where centralized management is not required. They offer flexibility and simplicity, as each device can be individually configured and managed, but this can lead to challenges in large-scale deployments due to the lack of centralized control and increased administrative overhead.

Lightweight access points (LWAPs): These APs are designed to work in conjunction with a central Wireless LAN controller (WLC). Unlike autonomous access points that operate independently, LWAPs delegate most of their functionality, such as security policies, SSID configuration, and client authentication, to the controller, simplifying network management and enhancing scalability. They primarily handle the transmission and reception of wireless signals and rely on the controller for complex processing tasks. This architecture allows for centralized management, easier updates, and improved security across the network, making LWAPs ideal for environments with large-scale or dynamic wireless deployments.

Guest Networks

Today, enterprise and even home wireless networks might choose to provide guest network services. Guest networks provide a separate and secure Wi-Fi connection for visitors, isolating their traffic from the internal network to safeguard sensitive data and resources. These networks are typically designed to offer Internet access without compromising the security of the host network.
To manage and authenticate users, many guest networks employ captive portals, which are web pages that users must interact with before gaining network access. When a guest connects to the Wi-Fi, they are redirected to a captive portal, where they might need to provide credentials, accept terms of service, or enter a voucher code. This process not only enhances security by controlling and monitoring access but also allows network administrators to collect user information and enforce usage policies. Captive portals can also present opportunities for branding and communication with guests, making them a valuable tool for businesses and organizations aiming to provide a secure and user-friendly Wi-Fi experience.
üß† Think of it like: A guest network is like inviting someone into your front yard (internet access), but keeping your house locked (internal network).

Antennas

The strength of the electromagnetic waves being radiated from an antenna is referred to as gain, and it involves a measurement of both direction and efficiency of a transmission. For example, the gain measurement for a wireless AP‚Äôs antenna transmitting a signal is a measurement of how efficiently the power being applied to the antenna is converted into electromagnetic waves being broadcast in a specific direction. Conversely, the gain measurement for a wireless AP‚Äôs antenna receiving a signal is a measurement of how efficiently the received electromagnetic waves arriving from a specific direction are converted back into electricity leaving the antenna.
Gain is commonly measured using the dBi unit of measure, where dB stands for decibels, and i stands for isotropic. A decibel, in this context, is a ratio of radiated power to a reference value. In the case of dBi, the reference value is the signal strength (power) radiated from an isotropic antenna, which represents a theoretical antenna that radiates an equal amount of power in all directions (in a spherical pattern). An isotropic antenna is considered to have gain of 0 dBi.

Antennas are classified not just by their gain but also by their coverage area. There are two broad categories of antennas, based on coverage area:
Omnidirectional: An omnidirectional antenna (sometimes simply called an omni) radiates power at relatively equal power levels in all directions; it is somewhat similar to a theoretical isotropic antenna. Omnidirectional antennas, are popular in residential WLANs and small office/home office (SOHO) locations.
Unidirectional: A unidirectional antenna (sometimes just termed a directional antenna) can focus its power in a specific direction, thus avoiding potential interference with other wireless devices and perhaps reaching greater distances than are possible with omnidirectional antennas. A Yagi antenna is a popular example of a directional antenna. One application for directional antennas is interconnecting two nearby buildings.
Another consideration for antenna installation is the horizontal or vertical orientation of the antenna. For best performance, if two wireless APs communicate with one another, they need to have matching antenna orientations (that is, their polarity needs to be the same).

Channel Frequency Options

    Channel width refers to the size of the frequency band used to transmit data between wireless devices, directly influencing the network‚Äôs data throughput and performance. Standard channel widths for Wi-Fi networks include 20MHz, 40MHz, 80MHz, and even 160MHz, with wider channels generally offering higher data rates by allowing more data to be transmitted simultaneously. However, increasing channel width can also raise the potential for interference, especially in environments with multiple Wi-Fi networks or other sources of radio frequency interference (RFI). Wider channels are more susceptible to overlap with adjacent networks, which can degrade performance. Therefore, while 80MHz and 160MHz channels are favored for their capacity to deliver faster speeds in newer Wi-Fi standards like Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax) and Wi-Fi 6E (802.11ax operating in the 6GHz band), careful consideration must be given to network planning and environmental factors to optimize performance and minimize interference.
    Non-overlapping channels are critical for optimizing performance and minimizing interference. In the 2.4GHz band, which is more congested and prone to interference due to its limited spectrum, only three non-overlapping channels (typically channels 1, 6, and 11) can be used effectively without overlapping adjacent channels, thus reducing the risk of cross-channel interference. In contrast, the 5GHz and 6GHz bands offer a broader spectrum, allowing for more non-overlapping channels that can support wider channel widths, such as 20MHz, 40MHz, 80MHz, and 160MHz. This greater availability of non-overlapping channels facilitates higher data rates and more robust connections, as devices can operate in a cleaner spectrum with reduced likelihood of co-channel interference.
    Regulatory impacts have certainly made their mark on the field of wireless. For example, IEEE 802.11h is an amendment to the 802.11 standard that enhances wireless networking by introducing mechanisms for dynamic frequency selection (DFS) and transmit power control (TPC). Developed to comply with regulatory requirements, particularly in Europe, 802.11h addresses the need to coexist with radar systems and other incumbent services in the 5GHz frequency band. DFS allows wireless access points to detect radar signals and dynamically switch to a different channel if interference is detected, thereby preventing disruption to critical radar operations. TPC helps in managing the power levels of transmissions to avoid interference with other devices and to optimize energy usage.
    Band steering is a technique used by modern Wi-Fi access points to manage and direct client devices to the most appropriate frequency band‚Äîtypically between the 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands. When a dual-band access point detects a client device that can operate on both the 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands, it can ‚Äústeer‚Äù the device to the 5GHz band to alleviate congestion on the 2.4GHz band, which is more prone to interference and crowding due to its limited number of channels and higher usage by various devices. Band steering helps balance the load across both frequency bands, improving overall network performance and user experience by reducing interference and maximizing the available bandwidth.

Types of WLANs

IBSS: A WLAN can be created without the use of an AP. Such a configuration, called an independent basic service set (IBSS), is said to work in an ad hoc fashion.An ad hoc WLAN is useful for temporary connections between wireless devices. For example, you might temporarily interconnect two laptop computers to transfer a few files.
BSS: WLAN using a single AP. A WLAN that has just one AP is called a basic service set (BSS) WLAN. BSS WLANs are said to run in infrastructure mode because wireless clients connect to an AP, which is typically connected to a wired network infrastructure. BSS networks are often used in residential and SOHO locations, where the signal strength provided by a single AP is sufficient to service all the WLAN‚Äôs wireless clients.
ESS: A WLAN containing more than one AP is called an extended service set (ESS) WLAN. Like BSS WLANs, ESS WLANs operate in infrastructure mode. When you have more than one AP, it is important to prevent one AP from interfering with another. Specifically, the previously discussed non-overlapping channels (channels 1, 6, and 11 for the 2.4GHz band) should be selected for adjacent wireless coverage areas.

Mesh Topology

A mesh wireless network is a collection of wireless devices that may not use centralized control (but instead features decentralized management). The combined wireless coverage range defines the range of the network. This could also be referred to as a mesh cloud. Additional wireless technologies (besides Wi-Fi) could be used to build a mesh wireless topology. This type of network could be used for hosts to communicate with other devices in the mesh, or the network could provide a gateway to the Internet or other networks.

Sources of Interference

A major issue for WLANs is radio frequency interference (RFI) caused by other devices using frequencies similar to those of the WLAN devices. Also, physical obstacles can impede or reflect WLAN transmissions. The following are some of the most common sources of interference:

Other WLAN devices: If two or more WLAN devices are in close proximity and use overlapping channels, those devices could interfere with one another.
Cordless phones: Several models of cordless phones operate in the 2.4GHz band and can interfere with WLAN devices. However, if you need cordless phones to coexist in an environment with WLAN devices using the 2.4GHz band, consider the use of Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications (DECT) cordless phones.
Microwave ovens: Older microwave ovens, which might not have sufficient shielding, can emit relatively high-powered signals in the 2.4GHz band, resulting in significant interference with WLAN devices operating in the 2.4GHz band.
Wireless security system devices: Most wireless security cameras operate in the 2.4GHz frequency range, which can cause potential issues with WLAN devices.
Physical obstacles: In electromagnetic theory, radio waves cannot propagate through a perfect conductor. So, although metal filing cabinets and large appliances are not perfect conductors, they are sufficient to cause degradation of a WLAN signal. For example, a WLAN signal might hit a large air conditioning unit, causing the radio waves to be reflected and scattered in multiple directions. Not only does this limit the range of the WLAN signal, but also radio waves carrying data might travel over different paths. This multipath issue can cause data corruption. Concrete walls, metal studs, and even window film can reduce the quality of the wireless network signals.
Signal strength: The range of a WLAN device is a function of the device‚Äôs signal strength. Lower-cost consumer-grade APs do not typically allow administrative adjustment of signal strength. However, enterprise-class APs often allow signal strength to be adjusted to ensure sufficient coverage of a specific area, while avoiding interference with other APs using the same channel.

Wireless AP Placement

A WLAN using more than one AP (that is, an ESS WLAN) requires careful planning to prevent the APs from interfering with one another while still servicing a desired coverage area. Specifically, an overlap of coverage between APs should exist to allow uninterrupted roaming from one WLAN cell (which is the coverage area provided by an AP) to another. However, those overlapping coverage areas should not use overlapping frequencies.If a WLAN has more than three APs, the APs are deployed in a honeycomb fashion to allow an overlap of AP coverage areas while avoiding an overlap of identical channels.The cells using the same non-overlapping channels (channels 1, 6, and 11) are separated by another cell. For example, notice that none of the cells using channel 11 overlap another cell using channel 11.
Although a honeycomb channel assignment scheme can be used for the 5GHz band, identical channels should be separated by at least two cells rather than by a single cell.

#Securing Wireless LANs

In the early days of networking, especially during the dial-up modem era, a technique called war dialing was used by malicious users to find vulnerable systems. This involved running a program that automatically dialed a series of phone numbers to identify which ones were connected to modems. If a number responded with a modem tone, it was flagged as a potential target for future attacks.
As wireless networks (WLANs) became more common, a modern version of war dialing emerged‚Äîwar driving. War driving involves driving around with a device like a laptop or smartphone to detect unsecured wireless networks. These networks can then be exploited either to gain unauthorized access to the Internet or to launch attacks on connected devices. Any device with Wi-Fi capability‚Äîsuch as a smartphone, tablet, laptop, or even some gaming consoles‚Äîcan be used to both access a WLAN or potentially be part of a wireless attack.
Another related threat is war chalking. When someone finds an open or vulnerable wireless network in a public area, they might draw symbols‚Äîtypically using chalk‚Äîon a nearby wall or surface to mark the network‚Äôs presence and details like its name (SSID) and whether it has security enabled. This is a throwback to a practice used by hobos in the early 20th century to leave coded messages for one another, and in the wireless world, it serves to alert others to available networks.

    WEP and WPA security cracking: As discussed later in this chapter, various security standards are available for encrypting and authenticating a WLAN client with an AP. Two of the less secure standards are Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) and Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA). Although WPA is considered more secure than WEP, utilities are available on the Internet for cracking each of these approaches to wireless security. By collecting enough packets transmitted by a secure AP, these cracking utilities can use mathematical algorithms to determine the pre-shared key (PSK) configured on a wireless AP with which an associating wireless client must also be configured.
    Rogue access point: A malicious user may set up an AP called a rogue access point to which legitimate users can connect. The malicious user might then use a packet sniffer (which displays information about unencrypted traffic, including the traffic‚Äôs data and header information) to eavesdrop on communications flowing through the rogue AP. To cause unsuspecting users to connect to the rogue AP, the malicious user could configure the AP with the same service set identifier (SSID) used by a legitimate AP. When a rogue AP is configured with the SSID of a legitimate AP, the rogue AP is commonly referred to as an evil twin. Rogue access points are just one reason it is wise to change default SSIDs on wireless equipment. And remember, do not use company information (brand names, divisions, etc.) when creating the unique SSID.

Note
An SSID is a string of characters identifying a WLAN. APs participating in the same WLAN (that is, in an ESS) can be configured with identical SSIDs. An SSID shared among multiple APs is called an extended service set identifier (ESSID). Sure enough, the basic service set (BSS) wireless network uses an SSID called a basic service set identifier (BSSID). While the SSID is often a ‚Äúfriendly name‚Äù that is relatively easy to identify, the BSSID is the MAC address of the access point.

#Approaches to WLAN Security

    A WLAN that does not require authentication or provide encryption for wireless devices (for example, a publicly available WLAN, such as the ones in many airports) is said to be using open authentication. To protect such a WLAN‚Äôs traffic from eavesdroppers, a variety of security standards and practices have been developed, including the following:

    MAC address filtering: An AP can be configured with a list of MAC addresses that are permitted to associate with the AP. If a malicious user attempts to connect via a laptop whose MAC address is not on the list of trusted MAC addresses, that user is denied access. One drawback to MAC address filtering is the administrative overhead required to keep an approved list of MAC addresses up to date. Another issue with MAC address filtering is that a knowledgeable user could falsify the MAC address of a wireless network card, making a device appear to be approved.

    Disabling SSID broadcast: An SSID can be broadcast by an AP to let users know the name of the WLAN. For security purposes, an AP might be configured not to broadcast its SSID. However, knowledgeable users could still determine the SSID of an AP by examining captured packets.

    Pre-shared key (PSK): To encrypt transmission between a wireless client and an AP (in addition to authenticating a wireless client with an AP), both the wireless client and the AP could be preconfigured with a matching string of characters (a PSK, as previously described). The PSK could be used as part of a mathematical algorithm to encrypt traffic, such that if an eavesdropper intercepted the encrypted traffic, they would not be able to decrypt the traffic without knowing the PSK. Although using a PSK can be effective in providing security for a small network (such as a SOHO network), it lacks scalability. For example, in a large corporate environment, the compromise of a PSK would necessitate the reconfiguration of all devices configured with that PSK. WLAN security based on PSK technology is called Personal mode (specifically WPA Personal mode).

Note
The latest WPA security approach (WPA3) running in Personal mode replaces the PSK approach with a more secure method of authentication called Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE).

IEEE 802.1X: Rather than having all devices in a WLAN configured with the same PSK, a more scalable approach is to require all wireless users to authenticate using their own credentials (for example, a username and password). Allowing users to have their own credentials prevents the compromising of one password from impacting the configuration of all wireless devices. IEEE 802.1X is a technology that allows wireless clients to authenticate with an authentication server‚Äîtypically, a Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) server.

#Security Standards

When you‚Äôre configuring a wireless client for security, the most common security standards from which you can select are as follows: WPA2 (Wi-Fi Protected Access 2) and WPA3 (Wi-Fi Protected Access 3).

WPA2
The IEEE 802.11i standard, which was approved in 2004, requires stronger algorithms for encryption and integrity checking than those used with previous WLAN security protocols, such as WEP and WPA. The requirements set forth in the IEEE 802.11i standard are implemented in the Wi-Fi Alliance‚Äôs WPA Version 2 (WPA2) security standard. WPA2 uses Counter Mode with Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code Protocol (CCMP) for integrity checking and Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) for encryption. You might find this referenced as simply CCMP-AES. Remember, as covered earlier, any version of WPA that uses a centralized server for authenticating users is referred to as WPA Enterprise mode. Any version of WPA that uses a configured password or PSK instead of a centralized server is referred to as WPA Personal mode.

WPA3
Wi-Fi Protected Access 3 (WPA3) is the latest security protocol for wireless networks, designed to enhance security and simplify connectivity compared to its predecessor, WPA2. Introduced by the Wi-Fi Alliance in 2018, WPA3 provides stronger encryption through the adoption of Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE), a more secure key exchange method that mitigates the risks associated with dictionary attacks. It also offers individualized data encryption for each device on the network, ensuring that data remains protected even on open or public networks. WPA3 enhances the end-user experience with easier setup processes, especially for devices without displays, by supporting features like Wi-Fi Easy Connect. Additionally, it includes improved protections for Internet of Things (IoT) devices and ensures better overall security for modern wireless networks.
