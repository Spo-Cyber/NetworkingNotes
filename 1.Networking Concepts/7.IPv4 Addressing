#IPv4 Addressing (Chapter 7)

Private IPv4 Address Classes:

Class A:
	First Octet: 1-126
	Default subnet mask: 255.0.0.0(/8)
	Private Range: 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255(10.0.0.0/8)
	Used for: Very large networks

Class B:
	First Octet: 128-191
	Default subnet mask: 255.255.0.0(/16)
	Private Range: 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255(172.16.0.0/12)
	Used for: Medium-sized networks
Class C:
	First Octet: 192-223
	Default subnet mask: 255.255.255.0(/24)
	Private Range: 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255(192.168.0.0/24)
	Used for: Small networks
Class D:
	First Octet: 224-239
	Default subnet mask: -
	Private Range: -
Class E:
	First Octet: 240-255
	Default subnet mask: -
	Private Rarge: -

Scope: Devices using private IPs can communicate within the same local network and may access the internet through NAT(Network Address Translation).

APIPA (Automatic Private IP Addressing)

	Range: 169.254.0.0 - 169.254.255.255(169.254.0.0/16)
	Subnet Mask: 255.255.0.0(/16)
	Class: B
	Purpose: Used when a device is configured to get an IP address automatically (via DHCP), but the device cannot reach a DHCP server.In this case, the device self-assigns an IP address in the APIPA range.
	Scope: This address range is local to the network and is not routable on the internet.Devices with an APIPA address can only communicate within the same local network.
	Common Usage: It is commonly seen in  Windows and other operating systems when they fail to receive an IP address from a DHCP server.The system assigns itself a 169.254.x.x IP address as a fallback.
	Limitations: Devices using APIPA cannot communicate with devices outside the local network or on the internet.

End users typically do not type in the IP address of the destination device with which they want to connect, instead, end users typically type in Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDNs), such as facebook.com.When connecting device on the public Internet, a Domain Name System(DNS) server translates an FQDN into the corresponding IP address.

			#Subnetting

Subnetting - divides a large network into smaller, manageable parts.
VLSM(Variable-Length Subnet Masking) - allows to create subnets(subnetworks) of different sizes based on you needs(rather than using the same subnet size for everything).
By subnetting the network, we can improve performance(less congestion) and security(smaller groups of devices).

!Basic Subnetting

Formulas.
Number of borrowed bits = Bits in custom subnet mask - Bits in classful subnet mask
Count of subnets = 2 raised to the power of Number of borrowed bits
Number of hosts = 2 raised to the power of assignable host bits (right side of the network addresses between octets) - 2(network and broadcast IDs)

For Example` if we have 192.168.1.0(/24) and want to subnet and set submask to (/28) , then number of borrowed bits = 28 - 24 = 4.
So the count of subnets in this network is 2 raised to the power of 4 = 16 => devided into 16 subnets whole network.

!Find Subnet addresses , and IP ranges of hosts in each Subnet

1.Determine the interesting octet by determining the last octet in the subnet mask to contain a 1.

2.Determine the block size by subtracting the decimal value in the subnet's interesting octet from 256.

3.Determine the first subnet by setting all the borrowed bits(which are bits in the subnet mask beyond the bits in the classful subnet mask) to 0.

4.Determine additional subnets by taking the first subnet and counting by the block size increment in the interesting octet.

Example.
Say that a 27-bit subnet mask is applied to the network address 192.168.10.0/24. To calculate the created subnets, you can perform the following steps:

1.The subnet mask /27(in binary) is 11111111.11111111.11111111.11100000. The interesting octet is the fourth octet because the fourth octet contains the last 1 in the subnet mask.
2.The decimal value of the fourth octet in the subnet mask is 224 (11100000 in decimal).Therefore, the block size is 32(256-224=32).
3.The first subnet is 192.168.10.0/27 - the value of the original 192.168.10.0 network with the borrowed bits (the first 3bits in the fourth octet) set to 0.
4.Counting by 32(the block size) in the interesting octet (the fourth octet) allows you to calculate the remaining subnets: 192.168.10.0 , 192.168.10.32, 192.168.10.64, ... , 192.168.10.224

So the broadcast addresses will be: 192.168.10.31, 192.168.10.63, 192.168.10.95, ..., 192.168.10.255

And the ranges will be 192.168.10.1-192.168.10.30,192.168.10.33-192.168.10.62,...,192.168.10.225-192.168.10.254

#CIDR(Classless Inter-Domain Routing)

CIDR is a method used to allocate IP addresses and route internet traffic.It was introduced to replace the old classful IP addressing system and provide a more flexible way of managing IP address space.

How to Calculate a CIDR Block:

1.Convert the IP address to binary.
2.Count the number of bits in the network portion(this is the prefix length).
3.Use the prefix to summarize the address range.

#Example:
For the network 192.168.4.0/22:
	The first 22 bits are network bits.
	The remaining 10bits can be used for hosts.
