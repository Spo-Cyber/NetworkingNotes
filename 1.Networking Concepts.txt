      #Layer 1: Physical Layer

#Multiplexing Strategy

TDM(Time-Division Multiplexing) - supports different communication sessions on the same physical medium by causing the sessions to take turns.
StatTDM(Statical Time-Division Multiplexing) - instead of giving each user a fixed turn (like in regular TDM), it only gives time slots when data need to be sent.
FDM(Frequency-Division Multiplexing) - divides a medium's frequency range into channels, and different communication sessions send their data over different channels.
OFDM(Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing) - like FDM divides frequency range into channels, BUT frequencies that are mathematically arranged(orthogonal) so they don't interfere with each other, even when they overlap.
OFDMA(Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiple Access) - is multiuser version of OFDM, designed for multiple users to share the same channel more efficiently.
- - - -
      #Layer 2: Data-Link Layer

Packaging data into frames and transmitting those frames on the network
Ensuring that frames do not exceed the maximum transmission unit(MTU) of the physical media
Performing error detection/correction
Uniquely finding network devices with addresses
Handling flow control

Data-Link Layer consists of MAC and LLC
- - 
#MAC(Media Access Control:
Physical Addressing - The IEEE Registration Authority assigns a manufacturer one or more unique vendor codes.No two MAC addresses in the world should have the same value.
Logical Topology - Layer2 devices view a network as logical(not physical) topology.
Method of Transmitting on the media - With several devices connected to a network, there needs to be some strategy for deciding when a device sends data on the media.Otherwise, multiple devices might send at the same time and interfere with one anothers transmissions.
- -
#LLC(Logical Link Control):
Connection services - When a device on a network receives a message from another device on the network, that recipient device can give feedback to the sender in the form of an acknowledgment message by two main functions` Flow Control(Limits the amount of data a sender can send at one time, to not overwhelm the receiver with too much information), Error Control(Allows the recipient of data to let the sender know whether the expected data frame was not received or whether it was received but is corrupted.)

Synchronizing transmissions - Senders and Receivers of data frames need to coordinate when a data frame is being transmitted and should be received.This works by three methods` Isochronous (network devices look to a common device in the network as a clock source, which creates fixed-length time slots),Asynchronous (network devices reference their own internal clocks, and network devices do not need to synchronize their clocks.Instead, the sender places a start bit at the beginning of each data frame and a stop bit at the end of each data frame.),Synchronous(two network devices that want to communicate between themselves must agree on a clocking method to show the beginning and ending of data frames.)

- - - - - - -
	  #Layer 3: Network Layer

Logical Addressing - network layer uses logical addressing to make forwarding decisions.
Switching - is making decisions about how data should be forwarded.there are three common switching techniques`
  Packet Switching: With Packet switching(same as routing) , a data stream is divided into packets.Each packet has a Layer 3 header that included source and destination addresses.
  Circuit Switching: Dynamically brings up a dedicated communication link between two parties for those parties to communicate.
  Message Switching: is usually not well suited for real-time applications because of the delay involved.A data stream is divided into messages, and each message is tagged with a destination address, and the messages travel from one network device to another network device on the way to their destination.Because these devices might briefly store the messages before forwarding them , a network using message switching is sometimes called a store-and-forward network.

Route discovery and selection - A router can maintain a routing table indicating how to forward a packet based on the packet's destination network addresses.A router have its routing table populated via manual configuration, via dynamic routing protocol, or simply be bing directly connected to certain networks.
Connection Services - at the network layer can improve the communication reliability if the data link's LLC sublayer is not performing connection services.There two techniques in network layer:
	Flow control: helps prevent a sender from sending data more rapidly than the receiver is capable of receiving it.
	Packet reordering: allows packets to be placed in the proper sequence as they are sent to the receiver.This might be necessary because some networks support load balancing, where multiple links are used to send packets between two devices.Because multiple links exist, packets might arrive out of order.
- - - - - - - -
		#Layer 4: The Transport Layer

Two common transport layer protocols are TCP and UDP:

TCP(Transport Control Protocol) - is a connection-oriented transport protocol, which offers reliable transport, in that if a segment is dropped, the sender can detect the drop and retransmit the dropped segment.Specifically, a receiver acknowledges segments that it receives.
UDP(User Datagram Protocol) - is a connectionless transport protocol, which offers unreliable transport, in that if a segment is dropped, the sender is unaware of the drop, and no retransmission occurs.
- -
Two common flow control approaches at Layer 4 are Windowsing and Buffering.

#Windowing: TCP communication uses windowing, in that one or more segments are sent at one time, and a receiver can attest to the receipt of all the segments in a window with a single acknowledgment.In some cases, TCP uses a sliding window, where the window size begins with one segment.If there is a successful acknowledgment of that one segment, the window size doubles to two segments, then four,eight, etc.This exponential increase in window size continues untill the receiver does not acknowledge successful receipt of all segments within a certain amount of time(RTT'Round Trip Time', until a configured maximum window size is reached.)

#Buffering: a device (e.g. router) uses a chunk of memory(buffer/queue) to store segments if bandwidth is not available to send those segments.
- - - - - - - - -
		#Layer 5: The Session Layer

The session layer is responsible for setting up, maintaing , and tearing down sessions.

#Setting up session:
	The session layer initiates a connection between two devices.
	It defines rules for communication, such as authentication and synchronization.
	Synchronization(Both devices agree on session parameters)
	Authentication(User credentials are verified)
	Rules for communication(timeout, encryption...)

#Maintaining session:
	Ensures that communication remains stable and uninterrupted.
	Uses synchronization points(checkpoints) to recover from failures.
	Manages data flow and controls session parameters.
	Example: In Video Streaming it keeps a live session running and handles buffering.

#Tearing down session:
	The session layer closes the connection after communication ends.
	Ensures all data is properly transmitted before closing.
	Frees up resources to avoid memory leaks.
	Examples: Logging out of a website, Ending a VoIP call, Closing a database connection after executing a query.

	Real-World Example: Online Banking Login
	1.Setting up session:
		User logs into their bank account.
		The server authenticates credentials.
		A secure session is established.
	2.Maintaining session:
		The user checks their balance, transfers funds.
		The session remains active while interacting with the website.
	3.Tearing down session:
		The user clicks "Logout", or the session times out due to inactivity.
		The server closes the session securely.
- - - - - - - - - - -
		#Layer 6: Presentaion Layer

Cnonsists of Data Formatting and Encryption

Data Formatting: The presentation layer handles formatting the text(or other types of data, such as multimedia or graphics files) in a format that allows compatibility between the communicating devices.
Example(A Windows sytem(UTF-16) sends text to a Linux system(UTF-8))
Encryption: Encrypts the data in such a way that if the data were intercepted, a third party would not be able to decrypt it.(SSL/TLS)

	Real-World Example
Email Transfer
	You send an email with an image attached.
	The Presentation Layer converts the image into Base64 so it can be transferred as text.
	The recipient's system decods it back into an image.
- - - - - - - - - - - -
		#Layer 7: Application Layer

Application Layer supports services used by end-user applications(NOT THE APPLICATIONS THEMSELVES ARE IN THIS LAYER).

It consists of Application Services and Service Advertisement

Application Services: are network-based functionalities that allow software to communicate over a network.
	Examples: FTP(for sending/receiving files), SSH,Telnet(allow remote login), HTTP,HTTPS(enable web browsing)
Service Advertisement: is the process of announcing available services on a network, allowing devices or users to descover and use them automatically.
	Example: the printer advertises its services (printing,scanning).Your computer detects the advertisement and displays the printer in the network devices list.You connect and start printing without manually entering IP addresses.

Network Devices👨‍💻
(Chapter 2)

Device - Description - Key Points
Router - Connects networks - A router uses the software-configured network address to make forwarding decisions.

Switch - Connects devices on a twisted-pair network - A switch forwards data to its destination by using the MAC address embedded in each packet. It forwards data only to nodes that need to receive it.

Multilayer Switch - Functions as a awitch or router - Operates on Layers 2 and 3 of the OSI model as a switch and can perform router functionality.

Firewall - Provides controlled data access between networks - Firewalls can be hardware or software based. They are an essential part of a network’s security strategy.

IDS/IPS - Detects and prevents intrusions - Monitors the network and attempts to detect/prevent intrusion attempts.

Load balancer - Distributes network load - Load balancing increases redundancy and performance by distributing the load to multiple servers.

Proxy - Sends resource requests on behalf of network clients - Can add to the security and bandwidth efficiency of the network.

Network Attached Storage (NAS) - Centralized storage device that connects to a network - Provides scalability and flexibility for the large amounts of storage today.

Storage Area Network (SAN) - A high-speed network that connects storage devices to servers - Allows mulitple servers to easily and efficiently access large amounts of storage.

Access Point (AP) - Enables wireless devices to connect to wireless and wired networks - Should provide the latest in security standards to help reduce security breaches.

Controller - Used with branch/remote office deployments for wireless authentication - When an AP boots, it authenticates with a controller before it can start working as an AP.

		#IP (Internet Protocol) Types

Internet Protocol (IP) is a network layer protocol, documented in RFC 791, that offers a connectionless internetwork service.IP provides features for addressing, packet fragmentation and reassembly, type-of-service specification, and security.
- -
Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) , in addition to TCP and UDP , is another transport layer protocol , documented in RFC 792 that reports errors and provides other information relevant to IP packet processing.It is used by utilities such as ping and traceroute.
- -
Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) , is a transport layer 'RELIABLE' protocol.'RELIABLE' means that if a segment is dropped , the sender can detect that drop and retransmit the dropped segment.
- -
User Datagram Protocol (UDP) can be considered an opposite approach to TCP.Unlike TCP,UDP offers unreliable transport.This means that if a segment is dropped, the sender is unaware of the drop, and no retransmission occurs.
- -
Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE).For example, let’s say you have traffic that you want to protect over an IPsec tunnel, but this traffic is multicast traffic. IPsec does not support securing this type of traffic. That is where GRE can come into play. The multicast can be encapsulated inside GRE, and then this GRE traffic can be protected by IPsec.
- -
Internet Protocol Security (IPSec) is a complex suite of protocols that is used to create secured connections between network systems.IPSec features the use of Authentication Header(AH) and Encapsulating Security Payload(ESP).AH handles authentication functions, while ESP takes care of encryption.IPSec also gets help from Internet Key Exchange(IKE) protocol.IKE negotiates cryptographic keys and security parameters to facilitate the secure IPSec data transmissions over the Internet.
- - - - - - - - - - - - -
		#Traffic Types

Unicast - one-to-one communication.the most network traffic , which travels from a single source device to a single destination device.(IP Range - Class A,B,C)

Broadcast - one-to-all communication.travels from a single source to all destinations on a network(broadcast domain` 255.255.255.255).Another type of broadcast address is a directed broadcast address, which targets all devices in a remote network (for example` 172.168.255.255/16).(IP Range - 255.255.255.255)

Multicast - one-to-many communication.offers an efficient mechanism for a single host to send traffic to multiple specific destinations.The router/switch receives data only once, and sends it to devices which want.The router must support PIM,IGMP for routing to the devices which are interested for getting data.(IP Range - Class D` 224.0.0.0 - 239.0.0.0)

Anycast - one-to-nearest communication (from a sender to the nearest of multiple receivers).Multiple devices share the same anycast IP address, but packets are routed to the nearest(or best) destination based on routing metrics such as shortest path or lowest latency.

Note - IPv6 doesn't support broadcast traffic, besides it uses a special all-nodes IPv6 multicast address.

LAN (Local Area Network) - interconnects network components within a local area (for example, within a building).

WLAN (Wireless Local Area Network) - LAN made up of wireless network devices.

WAN (Wide Area Network) - interconnects network components that are geographically seperated(for example, corporate headquarters can have multiple WAN connections to remote office sites).

SAN (Storage Area Network) - a network, which is high-speed, highly reliable, for the express purpose of transmitting stored data.

CAN (Campus Area Network) - a network, that connects multiple buildings within a limited geographical area (such as a university, corporate campus, or military base).

MAN (Metropolitan Area Network) - a network, that spans an entire city or large area, connecting multiple LANS and CANs over a larger geographical region.

PAN (Personal Area Network) - a network, whose scale is even smaller than LAN(for example, a connection between a PC and a digital camera via a universal serial bus'USB' cable could be considered a PAN.)

WAN < MAN < CAN < LAN < PAN
- - - - - - - - -

Client/Server Model

A central server provides services/data to multiple clients(devices).For Example , Websites, email servers, cloud storage, etc...

Pros:
	Centralized management(easy to control)
	Better security(admin controls access)
	Handles many users efficienlty(scalable)
Cons:
	Needs a powerful server(expensive)
	If the server fails, everything stops

- - -

Peer-to-Peer(P2P) Model

All devices(peers) are equal and share resources directly without a central server.For example(Torrenting, LAN gaming, Bluetooth file sharing).

Pros:
	No central point of failure(more reliable)
	Cheaper(no need for expensive servers)
	Scalable(more peers = more resources)
Cons:
	Harder to secure(no central control)
	Slower for large networks(no dedicated management)

- - -

Cloud Networking

Cloud Networking is the use of cloud-based resources to manage, control, and connect networks instead of using traditional on-premises hardware.(Everything is virtualized)

Pros:
	Scalable(Expand or reduce network size easily)
	Cost-Effective(No need for expensive on-site hardware)
	Accessible Anywhere(Managed remotely via the internet)
Cons:
	Depends on Internet
	Security Risks(Data is stored outside your control)
	Latency Issues(Can be slower than local neworking)

___ ___ ___ ___

Point-to-Point(P2P) Topology

Direct connection between two devices.(For Example, Ethernet cable between two computers)

Pros: Fast & Secure(no interference)
Cons: Not Scalable(only two devices)
- - -
Star Topology

All devices connect to a central switch/hub.(For Example, Home Wi-Fi router with multiple devices)

Pros: Easy to manage & troubleshoot.If one device fail, others work.
Cons: Central hub failure(entire network down)

- - -
Hub-and-Spoke Topology

Like star topology, but used in WANs.(For example, branch offices connected to HQ via VPN)

Pros: Cost-effective(only one central link needed).Easier to manage than full mesh.
Cons: Central hub failure disrupts all-spokes.

- - -
Full-Mesh Topology

Every device is directly connected to every other device in the network.It creates a redundant and highly resilient network.Every node connects to all other nodes.(For Example, a data center with multiple servers interconnected for reliability).
W = N * (N - 1)/2, where W = the number of WAN links and N = the number of sites.

Pros:
	High redundancy(if one link fails, data can take another route)
	No single point of failure(ensures network reliabilty)
	Fast data transfer(direct communication between devices)
Cons:
	High cost(requires more cables and hardware, making it expensive)
	Complex setup(managing connections can be difficult as the network grows)
- - -
Partial-Mesh Topology

Pros:
	Less expensive than full-mesh(Fewer cables and devices required)
	Improved redundancy(Some level of backup connectivity between devices)
	Scalable(Easier to expand than full-mesh)
Cons:
	Some points of failure(Not all devices have backup connections)
	Not as reliable as full-mesh(if a critical goes down, it may disrupt communications)

----------Three-Tier Hierarchical Model-------

The model helps seperate the logical functions of the network and ensures that hardware and software are targeted correctly.It divides the network into three main layers: Access Layer, Distribution Layer, and Core Layer.Each layer has specific roles, and each is designed to meet different needs, improving network performance and manageability.
- - -
1.Access Layer(Edge Layer)

This layer is the closest to the end users (like laptops, desktops, and smartphones).It provides users with easy access to the network in a high-bandwidth manner.
DEVICES: *End-user devices: laptops, desktops, tablets, smartphones.
	     *Layer2 switches(often called access layer switches).
	     *Wireless Access Points(APs).
Purpose: It controls user access and defines the equipment required to connect end-user devices to the network.
- - -
2.Distribution Layer(Aggregation Layer)

This layer connects the access layer to the core network.It is critical for linking devices in the access layer to the broader network and external resources(like cloud services, remote data centers).
DEVICES: *High-speed routers.
	     *Multilayer switches.
	     *Firewalls.
	     *Intrusion Prevention Systems(IPS).
	     *Proxy Servers.
Purpose: Acts as a mediator and ensures efficient communication between the access layer and core network, with high-speed data transmission and security.
- - -
3.Core Layer(Backbone Layer)

The core layer is responsible for moving large volumes of data between key network locations(data centers, or between locations in an enterprise).It provides speed and high-performance data transfer.

DEVICES: *High-speed routers.
	     *High-speed multilayer switches.
Purpose: This layer is focused on speed, reliability, and redundancy, ensuring that large amounts of data are transferred quickly across the network.
-------------Spine and Leaf Model-------------

A modern network topology designed for high-speed, low-latency, and scalable data center networking.

Two-Tier Structure: 1)Leaf Switches - Directly connect to servers and storage systems.
					2)Spine Switches - Provide high-speed interconnections between leaf switches.

NO direct connection between leaf switches - All traffic goes through the spine layer.
Each leaf switch connects to every spine switch - Ensures equal latency and load balancing.

			   *Scalablity (easily expand by adding more leaf/spine switches)
Advantages  -  *Low Latency (Equal hop count between any two edpoints)
			   *High Redundancy (Multiple paths prevent single points of failure)
			   *Better Load Balancing (Traffic spreads across all spine switches)
-----

Spine-Leaf vs. Traditional Three-Tier Model

|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|Feature 		  |  Spine-Leaf		      |	Three-Tier(Core, Distribution, Access) |
|-----------------|-----------------------|----------------------------------------|
|Scalability	  |	High  			      |	Limited						           |
|Latency 		  | Low(Two hops max)     |	Higher						           |
|Redundancy	      | Full Mesh(resilient)  |	Less resilient					       |
|Ideal Use Case   |	Data Centers		  |	Enterprise Networks				       |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

#Traffic Flow

North-South Traffic Flows: In the classic three-tier model, most traffic flows are north to south(and also south to north).This describes traffic moving from the core to the access layer and vice versa.
East-West Traffic Flows: In the newer spine and leaf type architecture , most traffic flows tend to be east to west (and vice versa).In this architecture , virtual machines and/or containers communicate with each other over east-west flows.

		#IPv4 Addressing (Chapter 7)

Private IPv4 Address Classes:

Class A:
	First Octet: 1-126
	Default subnet mask: 255.0.0.0(/8)
	Private Range: 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255(10.0.0.0/8)
	Used for: Very large networks

Class B:
	First Octet: 128-191
	Default subnet mask: 255.255.0.0(/16)
	Private Range: 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255(172.16.0.0/12)
	Used for: Medium-sized networks
Class C:
	First Octet: 192-223
	Default subnet mask: 255.255.255.0(/24)
	Private Range: 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255(192.168.0.0/24)
	Used for: Small networks
Class D:
	First Octet: 224-239
	Default subnet mask: -
	Private Range: -
Class E:
	First Octet: 240-255
	Default subnet mask: -
	Private Rarge: -

Scope: Devices using private IPs can communicate within the same local network and may access the internet through NAT(Network Address Translation).

- - -
APIPA (Automatic Private IP Addressing)

	Range: 169.254.0.0 - 169.254.255.255(169.254.0.0/16)
	Subnet Mask: 255.255.0.0(/16)
	Class: B
	Purpose: Used when a device is configured to get an IP address automatically (via DHCP), but the device cannot reach a DHCP server.In this case, the device self-assigns an IP address in the APIPA range.
	Scope: This address range is local to the network and is not routable on the internet.Devices with an APIPA address can only communicate within the same local network.
	Common Usage: It is commonly seen in  Windows and other operating systems when they fail to receive an IP address from a DHCP server.The system assigns itself a 169.254.x.x IP address as a fallback.
	Limitations: Devices using APIPA cannot communicate with devices outside the local network or on the internet.
- - -

End users typically do not type in the IP address of the destination device with which they want to connect, instead, end users typically type in Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDNs), such as facebook.com.When connecting device on the public Internet, a Domain Name System(DNS) server translates an FQDN into the corresponding IP address.

			#Subnetting

Subnetting - divides a large network into smaller, manageable parts.
VLSM(Variable-Length Subnet Masking) - allows to create subnets(subnetworks) of different sizes based on you needs(rather than using the same subnet size for everything).
By subnetting the network, we can improve performance(less congestion) and security(smaller groups of devices).

-------------
*Cheat Sheet*

Subnet Octet Value	Contiguous Left-Justified 1s
0 				    0
128 				1
192 				2
224 				3
240 				4
248				    5
252 				6
254 				7
255 				8
-------------
!Basic Subnetting

Formulas.
Number of borrowed bits = Bits in custom subnet mask - Bits in classful subnet mask
Count of subnets = 2 raised to the power of Number of borrowed bits
Number of hosts = 2 raised to the power of assignable host bits (right side of the network addresses between octets) - 2(network and broadcast IDs)

For Example` if we have 192.168.1.0(/24) and want to subnet and set submask to (/28) , then number of borrowed bits = 28 - 24 = 4.
So the count of subnets in this network is 2 raised to the power of 4 = 16 => devided into 16 subnets whole network.

- - -
!Find Subnet addresses , and IP ranges of hosts in each Subnet

1.Determine the interesting octet by determining the last octet in the subnet mask to contain a 1.

2.Determine the block size by subtracting the decimal value in the subnet's interesting octet from 256.

3.Determine the first subnet by setting all the borrowed bits(which are bits in the subnet mask beyond the bits in the classful subnet mask) to 0.

4.Determine additional subnets by taking the first subnet and counting by the block size increment in the interesting octet.

Example.
Say that a 27-bit subnet mask is applied to the network address 192.168.10.0/24. To calculate the created subnets, you can perform the following steps:

1.The subnet mask /27(in binary) is 11111111.11111111.11111111.11100000. The interesting octet is the fourth octet because the fourth octet contains the last 1 in the subnet mask.
2.The decimal value of the fourth octet in the subnet mask is 224 (11100000 in decimal).Therefore, the block size is 32(256-224=32).
3.The first subnet is 192.168.10.0/27 - the value of the original 192.168.10.0 network with the borrowed bits (the first 3bits in the fourth octet) set to 0.
4.Counting by 32(the block size) in the interesting octet (the fourth octet) allows you to calculate the remaining subnets: 192.168.10.0 , 192.168.10.32, 192.168.10.64, ... , 192.168.10.224

So the broadcast addresses will be: 192.168.10.31, 192.168.10.63, 192.168.10.95, ..., 192.168.10.255

And the ranges will be 192.168.10.1-192.168.10.30,192.168.10.33-192.168.10.62,...,192.168.10.225-192.168.10.254

#CIDR(Classless Inter-Domain Routing)

CIDR is a method used to allocate IP addresses and route internet traffic.It was introduced to replace the old classful IP addressing system and provide a more flexible way of managing IP address space.

How to Calculate a CIDR Block:

1.Convert the IP address to binary.
2.Count the number of bits in the network portion(this is the prefix length).
3.Use the prefix to summarize the address range.

#Example:
For the network 192.168.4.0/22:
	The first 22 bits are network bits.
	The remaining 10bits can be used for hosts.
